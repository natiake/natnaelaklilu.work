# natnaelaklilu.work — Portfolio (Single Page)

This repository contains a single-page portfolio prototype for Natnael Aklilu built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. It's designed for easy deployment to GitHub Pages and follows a dark, modern aesthetic with teal and saffron accents.

Features:
- Hero with lightweight particle network background
- Dynamic subtitle (typing animation)
- Projects grid, About, Blog, Contact sections
- Smooth scroll, reveal-on-scroll animations
- Animated Font Awesome social icons
- Responsive layout and image lazy loading
- SEO meta tags and Open Graph basics
- Minimal external dependencies (Google Fonts, Font Awesome)

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — interactions
- `README.md` — this file

Deploying to GitHub Pages:
1. Create a repository named `natnaelaklilu.work` (recommended for user site) or any repo for project site.
2. Push these files to the repository's `main` branch.
3. In repository Settings -> Pages, set the source to the `main` branch and root folder.
4. Wait a few minutes for the site to publish at `https://<username>.github.io/natnaelaklilu.work/` (for project sites) or `https://natnaelaklilu.work/` if using a repository named exactly `natnaelaklilu.work` with a custom domain and DNS pointing to GitHub Pages.
5. If you own the domain `natnaelaklilu.work`, add a `CNAME` file with the domain and configure DNS (A records to GitHub Pages IPs or use the recommended ALIAS/ANAME). See GitHub Pages docs for details.

Customizations / Next steps:
- Replace avatar placeholder with a real portrait (use `loading="lazy"`).
- Hook the contact form to an email service or use `mailto:` links.
- Add real project preview pages or link to GitHub repos.
- Optimize images and add a `manifest.json` and icons for PWA behavior if desired.

If you'd like, I can:
- Convert this into a ready-to-publish GitHub repo and push it.
- Create variations for light theme or add more unique Ethiopian pattern dividers.
- Add structured data (JSON-LD) for richer SEO.

Enjoy — small steps, strong direction.
