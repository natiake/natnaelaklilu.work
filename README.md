## ‚ú® Project Focus & Ethos

As a first-year Computer Science student from Wolayta Sodo, Ethiopia, my work is driven by a passion for creating meaningful, robust technology.

### üß† Core Technical Focus
* **Python:** Specialization in data handling, AI foundations, and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
* **C++:** Foundational strength in efficient algorithms, systems programming, and problem-solving.
* **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):** Deep focus on understanding complexity and optimizing performance.

### ‚úùÔ∏è Guiding Principle
My commitment to Computer Science is fundamentally shaped by my faith (Colossians 3:23). I approach every project with diligence and integrity, viewing technical skill as a gift to be used responsibly for the benefit of others and with a higher purpose.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This website is a single-page application (SPA) designed for simplicity, speed, and cross-device compatibility.

* **Front-End:** Pure HTML5 (for structure)
* **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN for utility-first responsive design)
* **Interactivity:** Vanilla JavaScript (for typing effects, gallery modal, and background animation)
* **Design:** Modern, minimalist Dark Mode aesthetic.
